# PyBer_Analysis

## Overview
In this project, I used Pandas libraries, the Jupyter Notebook, and Matplotlib to create a variety of charts showcasing the relationship between the type of city and the number of drivers and riders, as well as the percentage of total fares, riders, and drivers by type of city. The analysis and visualizations were used by the ride sharing company to improve access to ridesharing services and determine affordability for underserved neighborhoods.

## Results
The tables below, created using the program notebook, display the relationship between total fare amounts, city types, and driver.

## Summary & Recommendations

- Based on this analysis, cities of ll types experienced an influx of rides during the third week of February. With this occurence in mind, I would advise the company to implement surge pricing during that week to accomodate the demand. 
- This analysis shows that ride demand rural areas is much steadier than other places. I would advise hr to keep hiring in rural cities at a pace that matches this demand. 
- Lastly, suburban areas seem to influence the only steady rise in rider demand in mid-april. I would advise my team to keep analyzing this trend and to consider implementing surge pricing more in April for suburban cities.
